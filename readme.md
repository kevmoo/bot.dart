# dartlib
## All of the important libraries the dart team hasn't shipped yet

Starting by porting bits of the [PL javascript library](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/pl) and Google's [Closure javascript library](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/) to enable some interesting scenarios.

### Current Status

 * Core classes from Closure: `Coordinate, Rect, Size, Vec2, AffineTransfrom`
 * From PL: parts of the property model, a lot of the retained library, including panels and hit testing
