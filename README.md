# The Dart Bag-of-Tricks
## A collection of (mostly) general libraries to make working with [Dart](http://www.dartlang.org/) more productive.

Starting by porting bits of the [PL javascript library](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/pl) and Google's [Closure javascript library](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/) to enable some interesting scenarios.

# Try It Now

The __Dart Bag-of-Tricks__ (__BOT__) is hosted on [pub.dartlang.org](http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/bot).
Add the __BOT__ package to your `pubspec.yaml` file, selecting a version range that works with your version of the SDK. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  bot: ">=0.11.3"    # works with SDK v0.3.2.0 r17657
```

_Always check the [BOT page](http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/bot) on pub to find the latest release._

Versions change within the range when we release small bug fixes, but it changes outside of the range on any breaking change. See the [changelog](https://github.com/kevmoo/bot.dart/blob/master/changelog.md) to find the version that works best for you.

If you'd like to track bleeding edge developments, you can reference the the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kevmoo/bot.dart) directly:
```yaml
dependencies:
  bot:
    git: https://github.com/kevmoo/bot.dart.git
```

# Versioning

* We follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
* We are not planning a V1 for __BOT__ until Dart releases V1.
	* In the mean time, the version will remain `0.Y.Z`.
	* Changes to the _minor_ version - Y - will indicate breaking changes.
	* Changes to the _patch_ version - Z - indicate non-breaking changes.

# Dart SDK dependency

* We're going to try to keep __BOT__ in line with the [latest integration build](https://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-integration/latest/) of the Dart SDK and Editor.
* At this point, each SDK release tends to introduce breaking changes, which usually require breaking changes in __BOT__.
* Keep an eye on the [changelog](https://github.com/kevmoo/bot.dart/blob/master/changelog.md) to see how __BOT__ aligns with each SDK release.
